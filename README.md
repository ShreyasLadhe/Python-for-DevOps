# Python-for-DevOps

In this repository I have shared my code in the part of my learning journey of Python. Python is an essential and can be a pivotal tool to have mastered that can make a night and day difference in yout DevOps journey.

I have also added md files that cover the concept and some FAQ that will make the journey of learning python much more simpler

Here in this repository I intend to learn python the DevOps way and understand how it can be implemented in the world of DevOps for more streamlined and faster results.

I have also included 2 projects, one using BoTo3 for cost optimization and also one for using jira integration to perform DevOps tasks as a really good pillars to understand some real world applications of the concepts that we learn in Python. These are easily resume qualifying projects as they make use of bleeding edge technologies like AWS Lambda and Cloudwatch.
